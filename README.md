# Supply Chain Project for La Poste group
This project was done in collaboration with La Poste group to optimize their current delivery system and to propose new ideas for the future.

## **Problematic Issues Addressed:**

- Estimating the demand for parcel deliveries in Paris using population data and determining the number of parcels per inhabitant.
- Identifying optimal locations for potential distribution centers in Paris by analyzing spatial data and geographic centers of demand.
- Merging population and geographic data to visualize parcel demand distribution across various zones in Paris.
- Selecting a sample of potential distribution center locations and evaluating their feasibility.
- Optimizing the delivery network using Julia for precise allocation of parcels between distribution centers and demand zones.

## **Recommendations for the future:**

- Use trains to transport parcels to Paris from warehouses located outside Paris rather than using trucks.
- Use approprite train/metro stations inside of Paris as micro hubs.
- Partner with the RATP to allow some metro carriages to be used solely for parcels transportation. It is estimated that 6'OOO parcels could be transported by one metro.

## **Limits and potential solutions:**
Costs for this option are too high at the moment but several options to reduce them are possible, such as:
- Lockers at micro-hubs to encourage self-collection.
- Relation between RATP and La Poste to reduce hubâ€™s costs + closing unused ones.
- Increasing delivery costs for customers.
